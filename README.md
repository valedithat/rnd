## One Part Research, One Part Development

RnD is just as much a professional site as it is an online resource for all things developement and security. In a phrase, we like to think of RND as the place where we keep all of the solutions of our day to day problems, written in a manner others might find useful to their own problems as well as rants about current issues with modern day technology and security as well as guides and tutorials on GNU/Linux related topics.
